# Erik Chinellato, PhD Researcher

## PhD 
Applied and Computational Mathematics at Mathematics Department "Tullio Levi-Civita", Universit√† degli Studi di Padova (UNIPD), IT.
Member of the iNEST Spoke 9 [team](\href{https://inest.spoke9.sissa.it/it/il-team-dello-spoke-9/}{\texttt{link}}) researching models, methods, and computing technologies for Digital Twins.
Research activity and interests:
- Machine learning algorithms for embedded systems;
- Deep Unfolding technique for interpretable deep neural networks;
- Dictionary learning algorithms for the monitoring of machines and processes.
  
Thesis: WIP

### Projects
A (non-exhaustive) collection of projects I worked on during my PhD can be found [here](https://github.com/ErikChinellato/PhD). They include:
- DKF - Deep Kalman Filter: A machine learning reinterpretation of the Kalman Filter based on the Deep Unfolding technique. Extends applicability of the Kalman Filter beyond traditional settings. Can be used to 1) perform state estimation, 2) fix mismatched model parameters and 3) discover unmodelled dynamics. An ad-hoc regularization process is employed to manage all components of the algorithm.
